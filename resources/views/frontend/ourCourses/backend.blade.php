                            <p class="mt-5">Since the late 80s and 90s, the internet has transformed the way humans
                                access information, and web development has continued to evolve. Its central
                                importance to our digital world means web developers are in high demand.
                                Fortunately, anyone can learn the technical skills needed to be front-end,
                                back-end, or full-stack (both front- and back-end) developers.</p>
                            <h2 id="0-what-is-back-end-development" class="mt-5">What is back-end development?</h2>
                            <p class="mt-3">Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on
                                everything you can’t see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the
                                website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic,
                                application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They
                                use code that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand,
                                and delete data.</p>
                            <p class="mt-5">On a team, back-end developers collaborate with front-end developers, product
                                managers, principal architects, and website testers to build the structure
                                of a website or mobile app. Back-end developers must be familiar with many
                                kinds of tools and frameworks, including languages such as Python, Java, and
                                Ruby. They make sure the back-end performs quickly and responsively to
                                front-end user requests.</p>

                                                <p class="mt-3">Back-end developers and engineers have similar technical
                                                    skills, but different responsibilities. A back-end
                                                    developer is like a teacher, whereas a back-end engineer
                                                    is like a school principal who creates the big-picture
                                                    strategy. Back-end developers tend to focus on smaller
                                                    parts of the whole, such as applications and programs,
                                                    working with teams to prove their design methods are
                                                    viable.&nbsp;</p>

                            <p class="mt-3">Back-end developers are required to have technical expertise, analytical
                                thinking, and excellent collaboration skills. As a back-end web developer,
                                you should be able to work independently to design the web
                                infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
