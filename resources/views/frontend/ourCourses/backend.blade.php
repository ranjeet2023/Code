                             A back-end developer writes code that forms the backbone of a website or app. Learn more about this career field and how to get started.

                            Back-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites. Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.

                            </b>Back-end development means working on server-side software, which focuses on everything you can’t see on a website. Back-end developers ensure the website performs correctly, focusing on databases, back-end logic, application programming interface (APIs), architecture, and servers. They use code that helps browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data.

                            </b>Back-end developers and engineers have similar technical skills, but different responsibilities. A back-end developer is like a teacher, whereas a back-end engineer is like a school principal who creates the big-picture strategy. Back-end developers tend to focus on smaller parts of the whole, such as applications and programs, working with teams to prove their design methods are viable.

                                    This database then runs on a server that provides data upon request.

                                PHP is a powerful and flexible scripting language that is extensively used in web development. With its simple and intuitive syntax, PHP allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages and applications. It is an open-source language, meaning it is freely available and continuously evolving thanks to a vast community of contributors.

                                  <b>Server-Side Scripting:</b>
                                  PHP is primarily used for server-side scripting, which means the code is executed on the web server before the resulting output is sent to the client's browser. This enables PHP to generate dynamic content, interact with databases, handle form submissions, and perform various server-side operations.
                                  <br>
                                  <b>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</b>
                                  PHP is compatible with major operating systems such as Windows, macOS, Linux, and Unix. It can seamlessly run on various web servers like Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS, making it a versatile choice for web development across different platforms.

                                  <b>Extensive Database Support: </b>
                                  When a web browser reads an HTML document, it interprets the tags and renders the content accordingly. This means that HTML determines how the content is displayed on the screen, including the text formatting, images, and interactive elements.

                                  <b>Integration with Web Technologies:</b>
                                  PHP integrates well with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to embed PHP code within HTML files. This seamless integration allows developers to create dynamic web pages by mixing PHP and HTML, resulting in a rich and interactive user experience.

                                  <b>Vast Ecosystem of Libraries and Frameworks:</b>
                                  HTML is a fundamental skill for anyone interested in web development. It serves as the starting point for building web pages and lays the foundation for more advanced technologies like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript.
